        <h2> Jungle </h2>
        <p  >
          This is my first blog, and I&apos;m going to discuss about the <b>jungle</b>. In every era, forests were cut, states came into existence and this kept repeating every time. Do you know the importance of jungle or have you ever wondered why jungles were created? Which species are there in the jungle? Where will they go after cutting the jungle? Today everyone will try to understand why jungle is necessary or why trees should be planted.

          Jungle is necessary as well as city and village. Let us understand the life cycle. There are many species living in the earth, all of them are tied to the lifecycle of nature. For this lifecycle to continue to function like this. All the species will have to remain alive or their fossils will have to be preserved and this responsibility is not only of the nature but also of the human species, because the human species has been made the most capable and intelligent among all the species. The God is given as much as is required. Excess or shortage of any species can unbalance the life cycle. Let us understand this from an example, while making carrot pudding, all the details have to be taken care of. If you forget to add any ingredient to the pudding then the taste will change, Even if any ingredient is increased in it, the taste will be bad or if it is less, then the taste will not be good, but, if all the ingredients are added in the right quantity then the halwa will be delicious, and people say like that &quot;you have magic in your hands&quot;.

          Now, we move to next level, You think about it, if some rich and powerful people come to your house and tell you to get out of the house and then push you out, how would you feel? Have you ever seen in a movie that the owner of a big company sends his goons to a remote or backward village and tells them to go away from this village and everyone will get the value of their land. But people did not listen and then that company started destroying the pure villages with its goons. You might have ever heard in the news that a leopard, cheetah, or lion has entered the village, no one comes out of the house, and those wild animals are attacking the pets. Why do you think they would have entered the village? You might have seen around you, Some very poor people go to the city in search of work and some rich people abuse them and say that these dirty people of the village come to the city and why are they making the city dirty, your place is in the village, go there. All of these things are important to think about it. Take some time and think about it, and also ask yourself what you have given to the nature.

          I had seen a web series, name is &quot;carnival row&quot;, in that series some other species like humans (fae ,puk, etc) came into the city where humans already lived. Some people hate them, reject them, and abuse them, while some people fight for them and try to bring them together. But no one can tolerate another person having different qualities. Another species that lives in the jungle. They can become humans and can also take the form of flying, huge, dangerous, and terrible animals. They eat humans. Some powerful people burn their house(forest) and everyone dies but only one of them survives. Now he has no home left. Now he has only one way left to take revenge. That&apos;s why he moves to the city and starts living in disguise. Staying in the city, he would organize a fight between all those people and kill them one by one. Then humans and fae together kill that cannibal.
